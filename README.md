Edea Frontend Exam - Mixcloud API search app

Search anything on Mixcloud using their API and listen!
The design is basic and easy to use - intuitive and simple.
This app should basically work with any music library API - as the embedded player fits any API URL. 

Technologies used:
1. React - hooks
2. Redux
3. Various libraries for icons and the media player
4. SCSS

What I tried to do:
Write organized and neat code,
Break the code into modules and keep it clean,
Work with redux in order to make component interaction smooth.

What I learned:
React using hooks is much simpler to write and much more readable - no classes used here!

Notes:
1. Player does not autoplay - after endless reading I found that most players are blocked by modern browsers from auto-playing music/videos.
2. Errors in browser console are a part of this - I tried multiple players and they all gave me errors while working with the Mixcloud API - this does not interfere with playback or any other functionality whatsoever. All requirements work perfectly.
